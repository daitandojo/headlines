In 2000, then tánaiste Mary Harney opined that Ireland was spiritually closer to Boston than Berlin. In terms of spending and tax levels, the headline figures suggest we remain closer to other English-speaking countries, but even more so to the UK and Canada than the US – you could say more Bristol, Bolton or British Columbia than Boston or Berlin.

But because it attaches to your keychain, I always have it to hand – a big advantage. A year on, not only am I still using it, but other members of my family have also bought their own. On a recent family holiday, smartphones were being passed around the table so people could treat the collection of bug bites they had built up over the day. I don’t go anywhere without it.

The Pro version has a more secure enclosure, with a metal case and a rotating mechanism that tucks the device out of harm’s way. Not only does it protect it from accidental damage, it also stops the device from falling out of the case. It can’t be accidentally pulled out; you have to pull the enclosure and rotate it to extract the Heat It Pro from the case. ","type":"text"},{"_id":"DOJBNFVA5VEQJE4RSMFQAIGE3M","additional_properties":{},"content":"There isn’t a huge difference in size from the original, and it clips more securely on to your keyring.

As the name suggests, the Heat It Pro has a small light that will help you use the device in darker environments. When a Healt It Pro is plugged into your phone, the app shows a small flashlight button on the screen alongside the treatment options. Press that and the light is activated. ","type":"text"},{"_id":"VHKM7PG5WNA2HFGQTWJBFLCYPA","additional_properties":{},"content":"It is handy if you are out for a walk, for example, in the evening and feel the sting of a bite. You can treat it there and then rather than waiting for better light to make sure you get the exact site under the heating element. ","type":"text"},{"_id":"FVRNNWBVPVC2XOGITXU7QTZI6M","additional_properties":{},"content":"One downside to the light, however, is that you need to keep a closer eye on your smartphone during the treatment. When the Bite Light is turned off, the Heat It Pro uses the light to indicate that the device is ready, and when the treatment time has elapsed, flashing red while it is preparing, blue while the treatment is ongoing and green when it has finished. When the BiteLight is being used, you only have a white light – or whatever colour you choose – to illuminate your skin, so you will need to watch the smartphone screen for the treatment cues instead. It is a minor complaint, however.

","type":"text"},{"_id":"DGS43KN5QRCNFJSQ2JTZ3LNSPU","additional_properties":{},"content":"And while people debate the long-term efficacy of hyperthermia as a treatment, in my experience it works to stop the itching and pain in the short term at least, long enough that you don’t scratch the bites and turn them into welts.
